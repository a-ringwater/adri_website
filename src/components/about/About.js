          After several years of professional experience in London, I made a
          career transition into web and mobile development. With 3 years of
          experience in front-end development, I have specialized in JavaScript
          with React. Now, I aim to further enhance my skills by learning
          TypeScript. My work approach is always focused on code reliability,
          efficiency and continuous improvement.
